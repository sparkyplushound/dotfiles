# dotfiles
these are my dots for important things like emacs and the window managers I switch to, it also has some very basic configs for childish things like neovim and hyprland. One last thing, if you decide you want to use these, then please, feel free, BUT, I will not be helping you if anything breaks. sorry not sorry. I LoveYou
